# tk

`tk` is a minimal graph-based issue tracker for long-horizon AI agents tasks.

`tk` is similar to [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), but stores everything as simple markdown files with YAML frontmatter — no database or daemon to manage. `tk` started out as a Go port of the [ticket](https://github.com/wedow/ticket) single-file bash script, inspired by Joe Armstrong's [Minimal Viable Program](https://joearms.github.io/published/2014-06-25-minimal-viable-program.html).

`tk` has no TUI, and will never have one. It is intentionally minimal, and intended to be used in conjunction with `grep`/`rg`, `more`/`less`, and `yazi`/`ranger`. It's trivial to browse and edit issues directly in your editor (I personally use [yazi](https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim) and [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) inside [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)).

## Status

`tk` is a work in progress.

## Workflow

Use `tk` only for long-horizon tasks that cannot be completed in one shot (say 200K context sans-compaction).

To get started, [install](#installation) `tk` and append [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) to your `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`. Customize as necessary to adapt to your workflow - there are no hard rules here.

Enter plan mode with your AI agent, make a plan, ask the agent to *save the plan in `./.plans`, break it into 5-10 issues, each with a link to the original plan and file it in `tk`*.
From this point on, you can simply clear the context and direct the agent to *fix issue x-h42g* or *run `tk ready` and fix the next available issue*. Or, run multiple agents on multiple worktrees if you're feeling lucky.


## Key Features

- **AI-friendly**: Designed to be easily traced by AI agents following dependency graphs and context
- **File-based storage**: Tickets are `.md` files in `.tickets/`, editable in any text editor
- **Git-friendly**: Store `.tickets/` in git (like `git-bug`) or `.gitignore` it and use as a local todo list
- **Dependency tracking**: Define dependencies between tickets and visualize them as trees
- **Cross-linking**: Link related tickets together for better context
- **Partial ID matching**: Refer to tickets by any substring of their ID (e.g., `h42` matches `x-h42g`)
- **jq-style queries**: Filter tickets with `jq` expressions


## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/lo5/tk@latest
```

This installs `tk` to `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin` by default). Ensure this directory is in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new ticket
tk new "Fix login page"

# List all tickets
tk ls

# Show a ticket (partial ID matching)
tk show h42

# Add a dependency
tk dep h42 8a2

# View dependency tree
tk dep tree h42

# Update status
tk start h42      # Mark as in_progress
tk close h42      # Mark as closed

# Append notes
tk note h42 "Made progress on authentication"

# Query tickets
tk ls --status in_progress
tk query '.status == "in_progress"'

# Clean up dangling references
tk prune              # Dry-run: show what would be cleaned
tk prune --fix        # Actually remove dangling references
```

## All Commands

```bash

./tk help

## Ticket Format

Tickets are markdown files stored in `.tickets/{id}.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
